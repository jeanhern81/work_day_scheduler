This date stamped Work Day Scheduler will help keep track of your daily task with easy to read color coding that indicate what's coming up next.  Here's how to use it.

* Type in your task on desired hour and click save. 
* The days are color coded to help you see with a quick glance what's coming up. 
    - gray indicates the hours that have passed,
    - red indicates that current hour you're on,
    - green indicates what's to come.
* To delete the information simply put your curser on the hour, and delete the text, and click save. It's ready to use.
